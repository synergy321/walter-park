Walter Park ðŸŽ¢

Ever been stuck in a long queue at a theme park, wondering if thereâ€™s a shorter wait somewhere else? Thatâ€™s exactly why Walter Park exists.

This app gives you real-time ride wait times across 136 parks and 12,609 ridesâ€”so you can plan better, ride more, and waste less time standing around. No ads, no catch, just a simple tool to help theme park fans make the most of their day.

Still a work in progress, but itâ€™s getting there. Soon, Iâ€™ll be sharing a public TestFlight link here for those who want to try it out. Stay tuned, and if you love parks as much as I do, youâ€™re welcome to join!
